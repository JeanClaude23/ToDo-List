# ToDo-List
This is a simple form that will be used to enter your todos details using javascript. 
The form will have the following fields:
1. todo name (text input)
2. todo date (date/time input or text)
3. todo completed (checkbox for completed or not)
4. Save button
On click save button, the data of the todo will appear in a div. If the todo was checked as completed, its container div will have a green background and the text will be striked.
Every time you enter a new todo, the data will be added to the div that will contain all the todos. After the todo has been added to the DOM, clear the form.
